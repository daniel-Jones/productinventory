An inventory system written in C++ and Qt using a MySQL database.

This is a recreation of one I made for someone that wanted it as a website using PHP, rewritten in C++ and Qt as practice and with the intention of distributing it to them as an android application down the line.

Included is an import script written in python to import data from the old database into the new one, converting data as necessary.

Far from complete at this time.
